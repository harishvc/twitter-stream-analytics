#Twix [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/icambron/twix.js.png?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/icambron/twix.js)#

Twix is a simple but opinionated JS library for working with date ranges, and includes a customizable smart formatter. It's written in CoffeeScript and it depends on [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).

It allows you to do, among other things, this:

```js
var t = new moment("1/25/1982 9:30 AM").twix("1/25/1982 1:30 PM");

t.format();  //=> Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM

t.isSame("day"); //=> true
t.humanizeDuration(); //=> "4 hours"
t.count("days"); //=> 1
```

And much more.

##Building##

If you want to build Twix for yourself, you'll need to install CoffeeScript. Then clone the repo out and run this:

    cake configure build

Configure just installs the NPMs and brings in Moment as a submodule, so you only have to do that part once. 

Note that the source is `src/twix.coffee`; the output is `bin/twix.js`. You can run the tests via

    cake test
    
You can also run the tests in-browser by building and then loading `test/test.html`.

##Contributing##

Patches are welcome!

 * Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch. I merge develop to master when we cut a release.
 * Don't include your changes to the generated `.js` files in the patch; they're much harder to merge. I'll generate them when I cut the release.
