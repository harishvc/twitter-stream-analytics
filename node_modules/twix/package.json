  "readme": "#Twix [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/icambron/twix.js.png?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/icambron/twix.js)#\n\nTwix is a simple but opinionated JS library for working with date ranges, and includes a customizable smart formatter. It's written in CoffeeScript and it depends on [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).\n\nIt allows you to do, among other things, this:\n\n```js\nvar t = new moment(\"1/25/1982 9:30 AM\").twix(\"1/25/1982 1:30 PM\");\n\nt.format();  //=> Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM\n\nt.isSame(\"day\"); //=> true\nt.humanizeDuration(); //=> \"4 hours\"\nt.count(\"days\"); //=> 1\n```\n\nAnd much more.\n\n##[Documentation](http://icambron.github.io/twix.js/)\n\n##Building##\n\nIf you want to build Twix for yourself, you'll need to install CoffeeScript. Then clone the repo out and run this:\n\n    cake configure build\n\nConfigure just installs the NPMs and brings in Moment as a submodule, so you only have to do that part once. \n\nNote that the source is `src/twix.coffee`; the output is `bin/twix.js`. You can run the tests via\n\n    cake test\n    \nYou can also run the tests in-browser by building and then loading `test/test.html`.\n\n##Contributing##\n\nPatches are welcome!\n\n * Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch. I merge develop to master when we cut a release.\n * Don't include your changes to the generated `.js` files in the patch; they're much harder to merge. I'll generate them when I cut the release.\n\nContributors to the project as of 0.3.0:\n\n   123\tIsaac Cambron           76.9%\n    16\tTanguy Krotoff          10.0%\n     8\tLÃ©o S                   5.0%\n     5\tEdmund von der Burg     3.1%\n     3\tNathan White            1.9%\n     2\tSuzanne Hamilton        1.2%\n     1\tandresmoschini          0.6%\n     1\tThomas Durin            0.6%\n     1\tAndrew Wirick           0.6%\n\n##Changelog##\n\n * **0.3.0**: AMD support, basic internationalization support, bug fix for `countInner` and `iterateInner`.
